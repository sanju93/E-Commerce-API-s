I just wanted to make a E-commerce API's that is 
 1) create the product
 2) getting the products
 3) update the product
 4) delete the product

but before the making these 4 API's I need to make the user specific E-commerce API's because each product should be diffrent user so that's why user comes in this picture


So, I have done the user authentication with the help of passport library and I used thier atrategy that was local starategy so that i have done the user authetication.

After that i was created a form to adding the products and then i was created a get product button, update button and delete button of the product and i have used the library in this project like express,ejs template engine,mongooose to handle the mongodb,passport(passport-local starategy),connect-mongo(to store the session in db), and express-session(to create the session)
